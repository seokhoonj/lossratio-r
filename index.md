# lossratio

Loss ratio analysis and projection for insurance experience data.

## Overview

`lossratio` is a toolkit for **long-term health insurance** loss ratio
analysis from long-format experience data — one row per (cohort × dev ×
demographic) cell with loss and risk premium columns. Multi-year health
policies emit loss slowly: age-to-age factors are unstable in early
development, exposure (≈ risk premium) is the most reliable anchor for
projection, and structural shifts from product redesigns, underwriting
changes, or regulatory reforms accumulate across cohorts. The package’s
defaults — stage-adaptive projection, exposure-driven early development,
cohort regime detection (regime: a homogeneous group of cohorts that
share similar loss dynamics) — are tuned for this setting. The same
tools apply to any cumulative loss / exposure framework (mortality,
morbidity, general claims).

It provides:

- Three aggregation frameworks of the experience data: cohort × dev
  (`Triangle`), calendar period (`Calendar`), and portfolio total
  (`Total`)
- Age-to-age (`ATA`) and exposure-driven (`ED`) development modeling
- Chain ladder projection (`fit_cl`) and loss ratio projection
  (`fit_lr`) with three methods:
  - `"sa"` — **stage-adaptive** (default): exposure-driven before
    maturity, chain ladder after
  - `"ed"` — exposure-driven for all development periods
  - `"cl"` — classical chain ladder (Mack model)
- Cohort regime detection for structural breaks (`detect_cohort_regime`)
- Diagnostic and triangle visualisations

## Expected input

A long-format `data.frame` / `data.table` with at minimum:

| Column | Meaning | Example |
|----|----|----|
| cohort | Underwriting / accident period (any granularity) | `uym`, `uy` |
| dev | Development period since cohort start | `elap_m`, `elap_y` |
| `loss` | Incremental claim amount in the cell | numeric |
| `rp` | Incremental risk premium (expected loss) in the cell | numeric |
| group | Optional — coverage, product, age band, gender, etc. | character / factor |

[`as_experience()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/as_experience.md)
validates the schema and coerces date columns;
[`build_triangle()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/build_triangle.md)
then aggregates to the canonical cohort × dev structure with cumulative
columns and derived ratios.

## Installation

``` r

# devtools
devtools::install_github("seokhoonj/lossratio")

# remotes
remotes::install_github("seokhoonj/lossratio")
```

The package depends on `seokhoonj/instead` and `seokhoonj/ggshort`
(installed automatically via `Remotes:`).

## Quick Start

``` r

library(lossratio)

# Built-in calibrated synthetic experience data
# (per-coverage dev curve calibrated to a real portfolio's broad shape;
# cell-level values and cohort patterns are randomly generated)
data(experience)
exp <- as_experience(experience)

# Build the canonical cohort × dev structure
tri <- build_triangle(exp, group_var = cv_nm)

plot(tri)              # cohort trajectories
plot_triangle(tri)     # cell heatmap

# Age-to-age and exposure-driven development
ata <- build_ata(tri, value_var = "closs"); fit_ata(ata)
ed  <- build_ed(tri);                       fit_ed(ed)

# Chain ladder fit
cl <- fit_cl(tri, value_var = "closs", method = "mack")
plot(cl, type = "projection")

# Loss ratio fit (stage-adaptive by default)
lr <- fit_lr(tri, method = "sa")
plot(lr, type = "clr")
summary(lr)

# Structural change across cohorts
detect_cohort_regime(tri[cv_nm == "SUR"], K = 12, method = "ecp")
```

## Aggregation Frameworks

The same long-format experience data can be viewed three ways:

| Builder | Output object | Dimension | Use case |
|----|----|----|----|
| [`build_triangle()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/build_triangle.md) | `Triangle` | cohort × dev (2D) | Chain ladder, ED, SA projection |
| [`build_calendar()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/build_calendar.md) | `Calendar` | calendar period (1D) | Calendar-year trend / diagonal effect |
| [`build_total()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/build_total.md) | `Total` | portfolio total (0D, per group) | High-level comparison across groups |

After `build_triangle`, downstream columns are standardized to `cohort`
and `dev` regardless of input granularity (`uym` / `uyq` / `uy`, etc.).
Original column names and granularity are preserved as attributes
(`cohort_var`, `cohort_type`, `dev_var`, `dev_type`).

## Methods

### Stage-Adaptive

`fit_lr(method = "sa")` (default). Hybrid of exposure-driven and chain
ladder, switching at the maturity point per group:

- Before maturity: exposure-driven projection
  $`\Delta C^L = g_k \cdot C^P_k`$ — anchors the estimate to premium
  volume while age-to-age factors are volatile.
- After maturity: chain ladder projection
  $`C^L_{k+1} = f_k \cdot C^L_k`$ — preserves the cohort’s observed
  level once age-to-age factors stabilise.

### Exposure-Driven

`fit_lr(method = "ed")`. All future loss increments use exposure (risk
premium) as the denominator. Suitable when age-to-age factors are
uninformative or unstable across the full development.

### Chain Ladder

`fit_lr(method = "cl")` or
[`fit_cl()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/fit_cl.md).
Classical Mack chain ladder with optional log-linear tail factor and
analytic Mack standard errors.

## Visualisation

Both S3 generics dispatch on object class:

``` r

plot(x)              # base plot generic — line / panel diagnostics
plot_triangle(x)     # lossratio generic — cell heatmap layout
```

[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html) and
[`plot_triangle()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/reference/plot_triangle.md)
work uniformly across `Triangle`, `Calendar`, `ATA`, `ATAFit`, `ED`,
`EDFit`, `CLFit`, `LRFit`, and `CohortRegime` objects.
