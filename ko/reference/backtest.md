# Backtest a loss-ratio / chain ladder fit on existing data

Hold out the latest `holdout` calendar diagonals from the input
`Triangle`, refit the model on the earlier portion, project the held-out
cells, and compare the projection to the actual values that were
withheld.

The Actual-Expected Gap (AEG) follows the standard actuarial A/E
convention and is computed cell-wise as \$\$aeg =
\frac{value\_{actual}}{value\_{proj}} - 1\$\$ so that positive values
flag under-projection (actual exceeded expected) and negative values
flag over-projection. Aggregated by development period (`col_summary`)
and by calendar diagonal (`diag_summary`).

## Usage

``` r
backtest(x, holdout = 6L, fit_fn = fit_lr, loss_var = "lr", ...)

# S3 method for class 'Backtest'
print(x, ...)

# S3 method for class 'Backtest'
summary(object, ...)

# S3 method for class 'summary.Backtest'
print(x, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A `"Triangle"` object (or a `"Backtest"` object for the S3
  [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) method).

- holdout:

  Integer. Number of latest calendar diagonals to mask before refitting.
  Default `6L`.

- fit_fn:

  Fitting function. Default `fit_lr` (stage-adaptive loss-ratio
  projection); also supports `fit_cl` for single-column chain ladder and
  `fit_ed` for exposure-driven projection. If `fit_fn` does not have a
  `loss_var` formal (as is the case for `fit_lr` and `fit_ed`),
  `loss_var` is used only to select the comparison column on the fit's
  `$full` table; arguments for the fitter itself (e.g., `loss_var`,
  `premium_var`, `method`) are passed through `...`.

- loss_var:

  Character scalar. The **score column** for the backtest — the column
  whose held-out actual values are compared against the corresponding
  model projection cell-by-cell. This is a scoring choice for
  `backtest()` and is not, in general, the same thing as the `loss_var`
  argument of the underlying fitter.

  With `fit_fn = fit_cl`, `backtest()` forwards `loss_var` to
  [`fit_cl()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/ko/reference/fit_cl.md)
  (because `fit_cl` has its own `loss_var` formal that selects which
  triangle column to accumulate), so the score column and the
  chain-ladder accumulation column coincide; any column present in `x`
  is admissible.

  With `fit_fn = fit_lr` (default),
  [`fit_lr()`](https://seokhoonj.github.io/lossratio/ko/reference/fit_lr.md)
  does not take a `loss_var` argument — it always projects `loss`,
  `premium`, and `lr` jointly. Here `loss_var` is used purely to pick
  which projection column on `fit_lr$full` is treated as the prediction
  for scoring. It must be one of `"loss"`, `"premium"`, or `"lr"`
  (default), which map to `loss_proj`, `premium_proj`, and `lr_proj`
  respectively.

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to `fit_fn` (e.g., `method`, `alpha`,
  `recent`, `tail`).

- object:

  A `"Backtest"` object. Used by the S3
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) method.

## Value

An object of class `"Backtest"` with components:

- `call`:

  Matched call.

- `data`:

  Original `Triangle`.

- `masked`:

  Triangle used for fitting (with held-out cells removed).

- `fit`:

  The fit object returned by `fit_fn`.

- `aeg`:

  `data.table` of held-out cells with columns
  `(group_var, cohort, dev, value_actual, value_pred, aeg, calendar_idx)`.

- `col_summary`:

  Per-`dev` aggregate AEG (mean / median / weighted / n).

- `diag_summary`:

  Per-calendar-diagonal aggregate AEG.

- `loss_var`, `holdout`, `fit_fn_name`:

  Call metadata.

- `group_var`, `cohort_var`, `dev_var`:

  Variable name relays from `x`.

## Details

The `loss_var` argument plays two slightly different roles depending on
the fitter, summarised below. In every case `loss_var` is the column
that drives the AEG comparison; the difference is whether the fitter
consumes the same name as input or whether the name is only resolved
against the fit's projection table.

|  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| **`fit_fn`** | **Valid `loss_var`** | **Forwarded to fitter?** | **Compared column on `fit$full`** | **Notes** |
| `fit_cl` | any numeric column in `x` | yes (as `loss_var`) | `value_proj` | Score column equals the column being accumulated by chain ladder. |
| `fit_lr` | `"loss"`, `"premium"`, `"lr"` | no (fit_lr ignores `loss_var`) | `loss_proj`, `premium_proj`, `lr_proj` respectively | Fitter projects all three jointly; `loss_var` only selects the scoring lane. |
| `fit_ed` | `"loss"`, `"premium"`, `"lr"` | no (fit_ed ignores `loss_var`) | `loss_proj`, `premium_proj`, `lr_proj` respectively | Pure exposure-driven projection (additive \\g_k \cdot C^P_k\\); `loss_var` only selects the scoring lane. |

This means that `backtest(..., loss_var = "loss")` paired with `fit_lr`
is *not* the same operation as `fit_cl(loss_var = "loss")` under the
hood, even though both use the string `"loss"`. The former scores the
loss projection that came out of a stage-adaptive loss-ratio fit; the
latter scores a chain ladder applied directly to cumulative loss.
