Loss ratio analytics for **long-term health insurance** — cohort
development analysis, stage-adaptive projection, regime detection, and
backtest validation.

## Overview

`lossratio` is a loss ratio analytics toolkit for **long-term health
insurance**, covering cohort development analysis, stage-adaptive
projection, regime detection, and backtest validation. Input is
long-format experience data — each row (cohort × dev × demographic)
maps to one Triangle cell, with loss and premium columns (`loss`,
`premium`).

In long-term health insurance, new claims and premium are generated
and earned continuously within each cohort, so cumulative loss and
exposure grow together. Age-to-age (ATA) factors tend to show high
variability in early development, and exposure (≈ risk premium)
becomes a more stable and reliable anchor. Product
redesigns, underwriting changes, or regulatory actions can also
produce structural breaks that accumulate across cohorts.

In this setting, lossratio provides stage-adaptive (SA) loss-ratio
projection, supported by maturity point and regime detection. SA
uses an exposure-driven (ED) model before the maturity point and
chain ladder (CL) after it. Regime detection identifies homogeneous
groups of cohorts (regimes) that share similar loss dynamics,
separating structural break points and determining which cells to
use for estimation.

It provides:

-   Three aggregation frameworks of the experience data: cohort ×
    dev (`Triangle`), calendar period (`Calendar`), and portfolio
    total (`Total`)
-   Age-to-age (`ATA`) and exposure-driven (`ED`) development modeling
-   Chain ladder projection (`fit_cl`) and loss ratio projection
    (`fit_lr`) with three methods:
    -   `"sa"` — **stage-adaptive** (default): exposure-driven before
        maturity, chain ladder after
    -   `"ed"` — exposure-driven for all development periods
    -   `"cl"` — classical chain ladder (Mack model)
-   Cell-selection diagnostics — which cells to use for estimation:
    -   `detect_maturity` — dev axis: link beyond which ATA factors are stable
    -   `detect_regime` — cohort axis: structural breaks across underwriting
-   Projection diagnostic:
    -   `detect_convergence` — valuation $v$ at which the projected ultimate
        loss ratio stops revising (operates on a fitted `LRFit`)
-   Backtest and triangle visualisations

## Expected input

A long-format `data.frame` / `data.table` with at minimum:

| Column           | Meaning                                                       | Example            |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| cohort           | Underwriting / accident period (any granularity)              | `uy_m`, `uy_a`     |
| dev              | Development period since cohort start                         | `dev_m`, `dev_a`   |
| `loss_incr`      | Per-period claim amount in the cell                           | numeric            |
| `premium_incr`   | Per-period premium in the cell (risk premium for long-term health) | numeric        |
| group            | Optional — product, coverage, age, gender, sum insured, etc.  | character / factor |

`as_experience()` validates the schema and coerces date columns;
`build_triangle()` then aggregates to the canonical cohort × dev
structure with cumulative columns and derived ratios.

### Column convention

Throughout the package, cumulative is the unmarked default and
per-period values carry an `_incr` (incremental) suffix:

| Metric         | Cumulative (default) | Per-period (`_incr`) |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Loss           | `loss`               | `loss_incr`          |
| Premium        | `premium`            | `premium_incr`       |
| Loss ratio     | `lr`                 | `lr_incr`            |
| Margin         | `margin`             | `margin_incr`        |
| Profit         | `profit`             | `profit_incr`        |

Raw `experience` input is per-period only (`loss_incr`,
`premium_incr`); `build_triangle()` produces both forms in the
output. Fit functions take `loss_var` and `premium_var` arguments
(defaults to the cumulative slot names).

## Installation

``` r
# pak (recommended)
pak::pak("seokhoonj/lossratio")

# remotes (alternative)
remotes::install_github("seokhoonj/lossratio")
```

The package currently depends on seokhoonj/instead and seokhoonj/ggshort
(installed automatically via Remotes:; planned for removal in a
future release).

## Quick Start

``` r
library(lossratio)

# Built-in calibrated synthetic experience data
# (per-coverage dev curve calibrated to a real portfolio's broad shape;
# cell-level values and cohort patterns are randomly generated)
data(experience)
exp <- as_experience(experience)

# Build the canonical cohort × dev structure
tri <- build_triangle(exp, group_var = cv_nm)

plot(tri)              # cohort trajectories
plot_triangle(tri)     # cell heatmap

# Exposure-driven fit (additive ED intensity)
ed <- fit_ed(tri, value_var = "loss", premium_var = "premium")

# Chain ladder fit (multiplicative ATA factors)
cl <- fit_cl(tri, value_var = "loss", method = "mack")
plot(cl, type = "projection")

# Loss ratio fit (stage-adaptive by default — ED before maturity, CL after)
lr <- fit_lr(tri, method = "sa")
plot(lr, type = "lr")
summary(lr)

# Cell selection: maturity (dev axis) + regime (cohort axis)
detect_maturity(tri[cv_nm == "SUR"])
detect_regime(tri[cv_nm == "SUR"], K = 12, method = "ecp")

# Projection diagnostic: when does the projected ultimate LR stop revising?
detect_convergence(lr)
```

## Aggregation Frameworks

The same long-format experience data can be viewed three ways:

| Builder            | Output object | Dimension                       | Use case                              |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `build_triangle()` | `Triangle`    | cohort × dev (2D)          | Chain ladder, ED, SA projection   |
| `build_calendar()` | `Calendar`    | calendar period (1D)            | Calendar-year trend / diagonal effect |
| `build_total()`    | `Total`       | portfolio total (0D, per group) | High-level comparison across groups   |

After `build_triangle`, downstream columns are standardized to `cohort`
and `dev` regardless of input granularity (`uy_m` / `uy_q` / `uy_a`,
etc.). Original column names and granularity are preserved as attributes
(`cohort_var`, `cohort_type`, `dev_var`, `dev_type`).

## Methods

### Stage-Adaptive

`fit_lr(method = "sa")` (default). Hybrid of exposure-driven and chain
ladder, switching at the maturity point per group:

-   Before maturity: exposure-driven projection
    $\Delta C^L = g_k \cdot C^P_k$ — anchors the estimate to premium
    volume while age-to-age factors are volatile.
-   After maturity: chain ladder projection
    $C^L_{k+1} = f_k \cdot C^L_k$ — preserves the cohort's observed
    level once age-to-age factors stabilise.

### Exposure-Driven

`fit_lr(method = "ed")`. All future loss increments use exposure
(risk premium) as the denominator. Suitable when age-to-age factors
are uninformative or unstable across the full development.

### Chain Ladder

`fit_lr(method = "cl")` or `fit_cl()`. Classical Mack chain ladder
with optional log-linear tail factor and analytic Mack standard
errors.

## Visualisation

Both S3 generics dispatch on object class:

``` r
plot(x)              # base plot generic — line / panel diagnostics
plot_triangle(x)     # lossratio generic — cell heatmap layout
```

`plot()` and `plot_triangle()` work uniformly across `Triangle`,
`Calendar`, `Link`, `ATAFit`, `EDFit`, `CLFit`, `LRFit`, `Maturity`,
`Convergence`, and `Regime` objects.
